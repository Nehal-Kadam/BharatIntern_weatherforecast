This Weather App is a beginner-friendly project that showcases the fundamentals of working with the DOM in JavaScript. It demonstrates how to use the Fetch API to retrieve data from a third-party service, specifically the OpenWeather API.

The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can enter a city in the search bar, and the app will fetch and display the current weather information for that location.
